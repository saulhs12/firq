# Security Policy

## Supported versions

At this stage, only the latest `main` branch is actively maintained.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do not disclose vulnerabilities publicly in issues.

Preferred channels:

1. GitHub Security Advisories (private report)
2. Direct maintainer contact via repository owner profile

When reporting, include:

- Affected crate(s) and version(s)
- Severity estimate and impact
- Reproduction details / proof of concept
- Suggested mitigation (if available)

The project will acknowledge reports as soon as possible and provide status
updates during triage and remediation.
